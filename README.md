# Project_True_Depth_LU

Project is intended to provide a tool for creating disparity or depth maps as well as allowing the user to calculate calibration matrix and average line shift in height.

Project is under development still, so not all of the features that are mentioned in the app and are greyed out, actually fully have been implemented in the app.
